    "1) In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.1) \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- *,+,/,-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "ans:- A string is a data type used in programming enclosed in quotation marks.\n",
    "     A variable is a reserved memory location to store values.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    " 3)        Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "String- \n",
    "A string is a data type used in programming language enclosed in quotation marks. It consists ofcharacters.\n",
    "Integer-\n",
    "Integer datatype represents whole numbers\n",
    "Float-\n",
    "float datatype allows a variable to store decimal values.\n",

    "4)What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)  This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "expression and a statement?\n",
    "spam= 10 is an expression.\n",
    "Expressions are representations of value. They are different from statement in the fact that statements do something while expressions are representation of value. For example any string is also an expressions since it represents the value of the string as well.\n",

    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",

    "\"spam\"*3 \"spamspamspam\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8 Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Because we can't start giving variable an integer name. if we, we should begin with, a string.\n",

    "'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos' \n",
    "\n",
    "sol:  because 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings, if we have to concatenate it we need to do typecasting.\n",
